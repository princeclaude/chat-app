Chirp is a lightweight, privacy-first instant messaging web app built with React, Firebase, and Firestore.  
Instead of traditional usernames or phone numbers, Chirp uses a unique 5-character PIN for identification.  
This makes connecting with people simple, secure, and easy to remember.



About the Project

Traditional messaging platforms often require phone numbers or usernames, which can lead to privacy concerns, availability issues, or confusion. Chirp solves this by assigning every user a unique PIN that is easy to share and remember. Users can connect and start conversations without revealing personal details until they choose to.

The app is designed mobile-first with PWA support, meaning it works seamlessly on mobile devices while remaining accessible on desktop.
